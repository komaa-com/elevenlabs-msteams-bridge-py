description: "Install the bridge, configure the three required variables, connect a StandIn identity, and make your first Teams call to an ElevenLabs agent."
---

By the end of this page an ElevenLabs agent answers a Microsoft Teams call. You need Python `>= 3.10`, an ElevenLabs agent + API key, and a StandIn identity (the sandbox is enough).

## 1. Prepare the ElevenLabs agent

1. Create (or pick) an agent in the ElevenLabs **Agents** dashboard and note its **agent id**.
2. Set the agent's audio **input format** and **output format** to **PCM 16000 Hz** in its voice settings. This is required: the bridge relays audio verbatim, so any other format means garbled audio on the call.
3. Create an **API key** with access to the agent.

:::note
If you plan to use overrides (`EL_FIRST_MESSAGE`, prompt or voice overrides), enable those specific overrides in the agent's **security settings** first; ElevenLabs rejects non-allowlisted overrides.

## 2. Install and run the bridge

```bash
pip install elevenlabs-msteams-bridge
```

As a CLI:

```bash
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk_... \
ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=agent_... \
WORKER_SHARED_SECRET=... \
  elevenlabs-msteams-bridge
```

A `.env` file in the working directory is loaded automatically (existing environment wins). Or embedded in your own asyncio app:

```python
import asyncio
from elevenlabs_msteams_bridge import load_config, start_server

async def main():
    await start_server(load_config())  # same env variables as the CLI
    await asyncio.Event().wait()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Every option is an environment variable; the package ships a fully commented [`.env.example`](https://github.com/komaa-com/elevenlabs-msteams-bridge-py/blob/main/.env.example), and the [Configuration Reference](/elevenlabs-msteams-bridge-py/configuration-reference/) documents each one. The bridge listens on `0.0.0.0:8080` by default and exposes `GET /healthz` for liveness checks.

`WORKER_SHARED_SECRET` comes from StandIn in the next step.

## 3. Connect a StandIn identity

StandIn is the hosted service that joins the Teams call and dials into your bridge. Pick a tier at [standin.komaa.com](https://standin.komaa.com) (sandbox for an instant trial), pair, and you get a **shared secret**.

1. Put the secret in `WORKER_SHARED_SECRET` (both sides must match exactly).
2. Point the identity's **agent WebSocket URL** at your bridge, for example `wss://el-bridge.example.com:8080/voice/msteams/stream`. StandIn appends `/{callId}` per call.
3. Restart the bridge if you changed the env.

StandIn dials in **from the internet**, so a laptop or private host needs a public URL. A tunnel gives you one and terminates TLS (so you get `wss://` for free). Run one pointing at port `8080`, then use the `wss://…/voice/msteams/stream` form of the printed host:

Tailscale Funnel:

```bash
tailscale funnel --bg --https=8080 8080
```

Cloudflare Tunnel:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8080
```

ngrok:

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

VS Code dev tunnels:

```bash
devtunnel host -p 8080 --allow-anonymous
```

For a fixed production host use an ingress/load balancer, or serve TLS natively with `TLS_CERT_PATH` + `TLS_KEY_PATH`. Never give StandIn a plain `ws://` URL outside local testing.

More detail (tiers, what pairing does, cutoff behavior): [Connecting to StandIn](/elevenlabs-msteams-bridge-py/connecting-to-standin/).

## 4. Make the first call

Call your Teams bot (or join the sandbox meeting). In the bridge logs you should see the call arrive, the ElevenLabs session open, and the relay start:

```text
INFO  [server] worker connected for call 19:meeting_ab... (1/64)
INFO  [call:19:meeting_ab] session.start (direction=inbound, recording=unknown)
INFO  [call:19:meeting_ab] ElevenLabs agent session open; relaying
```

Speak, and the agent answers in its own voice. If the call connects but something is off, [Troubleshooting](/elevenlabs-msteams-bridge-py/troubleshooting/) maps every error you are likely to see (`401` handshake, `agent-unavailable`, garbled-audio format mismatch) to its cause.
