"""SSRF guard for agent-supplied URLs (show_image).

The tool params come from the agent's LLM, i.e. indirectly from the caller - a
crafted prompt must not be able to make the bridge fetch cloud metadata
(169.254.169.254), loopback, or RFC1918 hosts. Mirrors the same guard the
StandIn media bridge applies.

The DNS-rebind TOCTOU (validate-then-fetch re-resolves, and the second answer
can be private) is CLOSED for fetch_public_image: the actual connect goes
through a guarded resolver that re-checks every address against the same
private-range rules, so a rebind to a private IP fails at connect time.
